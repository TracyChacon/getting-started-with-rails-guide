# My Rails Tutorial Project

This project is a result of following the official Ruby on Rails Guides tutorial. This repository tracks my progress through the official Ruby on Rails Guides tutorial, covering fundamental Rails concepts.

The [Getting Started with Rails Tutorial](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) has the below learning objectives:

- How to install Rails, create a new Rails application, and connect your application to a database.

- The general layout of a Rails application.

- The basic principles of MVC (Model, View, Controller) and RESTful design.

- How to quickly generate the starting pieces of a Rails application.

- How to deploy your app to production using Kamal.

## Technologies Used

- **Ruby:** 3.2.8
- **Ruby on Rails:** 8.0.2
- **Database:** SQLite3 (development/test)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic, as per tutorial)

## Setup and Running the Application

To get this project up and running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    - Ruby (install is operating system dependent see [Ruby Documentation Page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/) )
    - Bundler (`gem install bundler`)

2.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/TracyChacon/getting-started-with-rails-guide.git](https://github.com/TracyChacon/getting-started-with-rails-guide.git)
    cd getting-started-with-rails-guide
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    bundle install
    yarn install # if using Rails 7+ with default asset management
    ```

4.  **Database Setup:**

    ```bash
    rails db:migrate

    ```

5.  **Run the Rails Server:**

    ```bash
    rails server
    ```

6.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Challeges/Learning

My first challenge embarking on this Rails tutorial was the Ruby language itself. While I have prior experience with C, C++, Python, and JavaScript, understanding Ruby's syntax and idiomatic expressions presented a new hurdle, especially when coupled with the intricacies of Rails.

To address this, I undertook several preparatory steps. I extensively consulted the [official Ruby Documentation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/) to grasp core concepts and worked through the ["Ruby in Twenty Minutes"](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/) guide to gain a foundational understanding. Additionally, I joined [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby) and began practicing Ruby exercises. This platform appealed to me as a fun and effective way to reinforce my learning; I had already explored it prior to a community recommendation. While "The Odin Project" was also suggested, I ultimately chose Exercism due to my prior familiarity and its interactive learning approach.

9. Routes
   This lays the groundwork for building interactive web applications by establishing how user requests are received and processed within the Rails framework.

Summary:

- **Anatomy of a URL:** Understanding protocol, host, path, and query parameters.
- **HTTP Methods:** Differentiating between GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests and their purposes.
- **Rails Routes:** How `config/routes.rb` maps HTTP methods and URL paths to controller actions (e.g., `get "/products", to: "products#index"`).
- **Route Parameters:** Utilizing dynamic segments in URLs (e.g., `:id`, `:title`) to capture data for controller use.
- **CRUD Routes:** The eight common routes for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a resource (index, new, create, show, edit, update, destroy).
- **Resource Routes:** The `resources :products` shortcut for automatically generating all standard CRUD routes for a given resource, significantly reducing boilerplate.
- **`bin/rails routes` command:** Using this command to inspect and verify all defined routes in the application, including those generated by `resources`.
